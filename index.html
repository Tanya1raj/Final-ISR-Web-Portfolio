      <h2>🚀 Mission Statement</h2>

      <p>Values and Goals
The concept that I employed with my IT Supervisor Readiness Web Portfolio was to create a formal, business-focused presentation of my leadership, analytical, and service management skills. I intended to develop a performance-based, ethical, and people-focused portfolio according to my long-standing desire of being a SAP S/4HANA-SD Consultant. SAP consultants will work to integrate functional business experience with the knowledge of end-to-end client service procedures. Through this project, I was able to establish a framework for dealing with service delivery, escalation matrices, incident reports, and SLA-based KPIs, which are all critical in the environment of the SAP Sales and Distribution (SD) module.
